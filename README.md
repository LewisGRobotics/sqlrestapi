# sqlrestapi
 
 Work in Progress!!
 
 This is an SQL REST API made with Spring Boot for my other project "What is on your mind?"
 
 Made using Spring Boot and PostgresSQL, this intends to create a backend server for the application that could replace the Google Cloud database. This would allow me more control over the database, permit complex queries and host my own backend server instead of relying on 3rd party.
